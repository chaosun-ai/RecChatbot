2. A fashionable midi dress with a unique pattern or print. Opt for bold colors or abstract designs to make a statement.

3. A trendy graphic t-shirt paired with high-waisted jeans and a stylish jacket. This casual yet fashionable ensemble is perfect for a teenager who loves modern fashion.

4. A stylish blazer paired with tailored trousers or a skirt. This sophisticated outfit can be dressed up with heels or dressed down with sneakers, depending on her style.
